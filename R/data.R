#' Daily returns for three major US banks
#'
#' This data frame contains daily returns for three major
#' banks, namely Chase (\code{C}), Bank of America (\code{BAC})
#' and Goldman Sachs (\code{GS}) for the period 2000-2020.
#' The data were extracted using `tidyquant` and computed from
#' adjusted returns, with the difference relative to the previous day
#' of operation, with \eqn{r_t=(Y_t-Y_{t-1})/Y_{t-1}}.
#' The \code{date} field contains the date
#' during which the return is calculated.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 5283 rows and the following four variables
#' \describe{
#' \item{date}{\code{Date} at which the return is calculated}
#' \item{retC}{returns for Chase}
#' \item{retBAC}{returns for Bank of America}
#' \item{retGS}{returns for Goldman Sachs}
#' }

#' Fort Collins weather data
#'
#' This data is extracted from the \code{extRemes} package
#' and consists of daily cumulated precipitation (in mm), minimum and maximum temperature (in degree Celcius).
#' The astute reader will notice that the precipitation series
#' (reported in inches according to the documentation) has been multiplied by 100.
